# ChIP-Seq Project
## Analysis of ChIP-Seq data for RUNX2 in an osteosarcoma cell line

This document contains the final project for the "Regulatory Sequence Analysis" module, part of the Bioinformatics and Statistics II class given at LCG-UNAM in February 2022. The original class material from Dr. Jacques van Helden can be found [here](http://jvanheld.github.io/LCG_BEII/).

For this project, we selected RUNX2 as our transcription factor of interest, downloaded ChIP-seq peak data for this TF from a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line from [ReMap2022](https://remap.univ-amu.fr/), a database of TF binding regions, and analyzed this data to identify transcription factor binding site motifs.
